# Library_Management_System_
A fully normalized PostgreSQL database designed for a Library Management System, implemented using pgAdmin 4. This project follows all five normal forms (1NF through 5NF) and supports core library operations such as book cataloging, member registration, borrowing, returns, and fine management.

# 📌 Features
✅ Complete normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)

✅ Referential integrity with foreign key constraints

✅ Data validation using CHECK constraints

✅ Indexed columns for optimized query performance

✅ Full CRUD operations demonstrated

✅ Ready-to-run SQL scripts

# 🗂️ Database Schema
Core Tables (8 Entities)
Publisher – Publishing company details

Author – Book authors

Book – Main catalog with ISBN, title, price, and available copies

Book_Author – Many-to-many relationship between books and authors

Reader – Library members (first, middle, last name, contact info)

Staff – Library employees with login credentials

Book_Loan – Tracks borrowing transactions and due dates

Fine – Manages overdue penalties

# 🔍 Normalization Highlights
1NF
Atomic values only

No composite or repeating attributes

2NF
Single-column primary keys (SERIAL)

No partial dependencies

3NF
Extracted Author entity to remove transitive dependency

Junction table for many-to-many relationships

BCNF, 4NF, 5NF
Single determinant per table

Lossless decomposition maintained

No multi-valued dependencies

# 📥 Installation & Usage
Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4

Create a new database

Run the provided SQL script to create all tables and constraints

Execute sample transactions (see below)

# 📄 Sample Transactions
Borrow a book:

Ali Khan borrowed "The Kite Runner" (ISBN: 9780143034902)

Available copies decreased from 5 → 4

Loan record created with 14-day due date

Overdue fine issued:

Sara Ahmed borrowed "Harry Potter" (overdue)

Fine: PKR 120 for 6 days late

Available copies decreased from 10 → 9

Return a book:

Ali returned his book

Loan status updated to Returned

Available copies increased back to 5

# 🎯 Project Objectives Achieved

✔ Fully normalized database (1NF–5NF)

✔ Enforced referential integrity

✔ Data validation through constraints

✔ Optimized performance with indexing

✔ Clear documentation and ER diagrams

✔ Production-ready design

# 📌 Conclusion
This Library Management System database is a practical implementation of advanced relational database design principles. It balances academic rigor (normalization proofs) with real-world usability, supporting all essential library operations with integrity, efficiency, and scalability.
